# Vanguard Case Study

## Overview

This case study investigates the impact of a new user interface (UI) design on various aspects of user interaction. The primary objective is to determine whether the new UI enhances user experience and efficiency by measuring completion rates, onboarding times, and error rates.

### Hypotheses

The study is guided by the following hypotheses:

**H1: New UI design results in higher completion rates**
- We hypothesize that the new UI design will lead to a higher percentage of users completing the onboarding process.

**H2: New UI design results in faster onboarding times**
- We hypothesize that the new UI design will reduce the time it takes for users to complete the onboarding process.

**H3: New UI design results in lower error rates**
- We hypothesize that the new UI design will result in fewer errors during the onboarding process.

## Methodology

To test these hypotheses, the following methodology will be used:

### Data Collection

1. **User Interaction Data**: Collect metrics such as completion rates, onboarding times, and error rates from two groups of users â€“ those using the old UI and those using the new UI.

### Experiment Design

1. **Control and Test Groups**: Randomly assign users to either the old UI group (control) or the new UI group (test) to ensure unbiased results.
2. **A/B Testing**: Conduct A/B testing to compare the different UI designs.

### Analysis

1. **Statistical Tests**: Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to analyze the differences between the control and test groups.
2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Evaluate completion rates, onboarding times, and error rates.

## Results

The results section will contain a detailed analysis of the data collected, including statistical significance and effect sizes for each hypothesis.

- **H1 Results**: Analysis on whether the new UI design led to higher completion rates.
- **H2 Results**: Analysis on whether the new UI design led to faster onboarding times.
- **H3 Results**: Analysis on whether the new UI design resulted in lower error rates.

## Conclusion

The conclusion will summarize the findings of the case study, highlighting whether each hypothesis was supported or refuted by the data. Recommendations for future UI improvements will also be provided based on the results.
